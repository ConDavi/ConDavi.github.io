Hi there!  
I'm a PhD student currently at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (MPI-EVA) in Leipzig, Germany.  
I broadly study how communities understand and adapt to ecological change, and how these processes impact conservation policy.  
I work with fishing and ranching communities in Baja Calfiornia Sur, Mexico under the advsiroship of Jeff Andrews, Shane Macfarlan, and many others.
